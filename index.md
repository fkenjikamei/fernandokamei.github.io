I completed my Master degree in Computer Science at the [Center of Informatic](https://www.cin.ufpe.br) (CIn) at [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br) (UFPE), in 2012. I'm also a Professor at the [Federal Institute of Alagoas](https://www.ifal.edu.br) (IFAL), Brazil.

I research the intersections of Software Engineering and Empirical studies. Currently, I am Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) in Brazil, under supervising of [Dr. SÃ©rgio Soares](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~scbs/) and [Dr. Gustavo Pinto](http://gustavopinto.org/). My research investigation is about *Grey Literature in Software Engineering*. I am also interested in research about Agile methods and Software Quality.
