Ph.D. in Computer Science and Associate Professor at the [Instituto Federal de Alagoas](https://www.ifal.edu.br) (IFAL), Brazil.

I research the intersections of Software Engineering and Empirical studies. My Ph.D. degree was at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) in Brazil, under supervise of [Dr. SÃ©rgio Soares](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~scbs/) and [Dr. Gustavo Pinto](http://gustavopinto.org/). My research investigation was about *Grey Literature in Software Engineering*. 

I am also interested in research about:
- Use the Empirical methods to improve Software Engineering
- Social Aspects of Software Engineering
- Software Quality and Agile methods
