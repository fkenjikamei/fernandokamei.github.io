I reearch about how to improve the use of **Grey Literature** as evidence for software engineering researchers. Also, I always like to research about **social aspects** of software engineering.

## Current research investigations
* Grey literature in Software Engineering with [**Dr. S&eacute;rgio Soares (UFPE)**](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~scbs/) and [**Dr. Gustavo Pinto (UFPA)**](www.gustavopinto.org)
* Empirical methods 


## Partnerships
* Igor Wiese (UTFPR, Brazil)
* M&aacute;rcio Ribeiro (UFAL, Brazil)
* Crescencio Lima (IFBA, Brazil)
* Ivanilton Polato (UTFPR, Brazil)
* Vilmar Nepomuceno (IFPE, Brazil)
* Waldemar Ferreira (Cat&oacute;olica, Brazil)
